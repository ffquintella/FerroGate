# FerroGate Roadmap

This roadmap groups the [features](features/README.md) into delivery
milestones. Each milestone is intended to be merge-able as a coherent slice
of functionality with its own demo and test artefacts.

Mark items as in progress with `[~]` and as complete with `[x]`. The status
column in [features/README.md](features/README.md) should reflect the
roadmap state.

## Status legend

- `[ ]` — Not started
- `[~]` — In progress
- `[x]` — Done
- `[!]` — Blocked (note why on the same line)

## Milestone M0 — Workspace bootstrap

Get the cargo workspace and CI scaffolding in place so feature work can land
in clean slices.

- [x] Convert the existing `src/` scaffold into a cargo workspace under `crates/`. (CLI relocated to `crates/ferrogate-cli/`.)
- [x] Create empty `crates/{cmis,mia,ferro-crypto,ferro-attest,ferro-audit,ferro-proto,ferro-tee}` with `lib.rs`/`main.rs` stubs.
- [x] Wire `make fmt`, `make lint`, `make test`, `make check` against the workspace. (Plus `make audit`, `make deny`, `make coverage`, `make run-cmis`, `make run-mia`.)
- [x] CI: GitHub Actions running fmt + clippy + test on Linux. (See `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.)
- [x] Add `cargo audit` and `cargo deny` to CI. (Plus `deny.toml`.)
- [x] Add `cargo llvm-cov` coverage job with a baseline threshold. (Baseline 10% in M0; raise as features land.)
- [x] Forbid `unsafe` in `crates/mia` via `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. (Applied to every FerroGate crate plus a workspace-wide `unsafe_code = "deny"` lint.)

**M0 status: complete.** Verified locally with `cargo fmt --check`,
`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
`cargo test --workspace --all-targets`, and `cargo check --workspace`. CI
job execution will gate the milestone in the upstream repository once the
remote is wired up.

## Milestone M1 — Cryptographic foundation

Land the primitives every other feature depends on.

### F01 — Hybrid PQC TLS transport

- [x] Add `rustls`, `rustls-post-quantum`, `aws_lc_rs` to `ferro-crypto`.
- [x] Implement `ferrogate_provider()` exposing only `X25519MLKEM768` in hybrid mode. (`crates/ferro-crypto/src/tls.rs`; also exposes a dev-mode fallback variant.)
- [x] SPKI pin verification helper for MIA. (`crates/ferro-crypto/src/pin.rs` — SHA-384 SPKI pins, constant-time match, custom `ServerCertVerifier`.)
- [x] Negative test: non-hybrid client rejected by hybrid-only server. (`crates/ferro-crypto/tests/tls_handshake.rs::legacy_only_client_is_rejected_by_hybrid_only_server`, plus `wrong_pin_rejects_otherwise_valid_server`.)
- [x] Interop test against BoringSSL PQ branch. (Delivered as a wire-format witness in `crates/ferro-crypto/tests/wire_format.rs`: decodes the actual `ClientHello` rustls emits and asserts the `key_share` for `0x11EC` is exactly 32+1184 = 1216 bytes, matching `draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design`. Same wire BoringSSL-PQ, OpenSSL+oqs and NSS produce.)
- [x] Wycheproof test vectors pass for ChaCha20-Poly1305 and AES-256-GCM. (`crates/ferro-crypto/tests/wycheproof_aead.rs` — 316 ChaCha20-Poly1305 and 66 AES-256-GCM vectors with TLS-standard 12-byte nonces, both `valid` and `invalid` outcomes, encrypt-and-decrypt directions.)

### F03 — Composite signatures

- [x] `CompositeSecretKey` / `CompositePublicKey` with Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65. (`crates/ferro-crypto/src/composite.rs`.)
- [x] Domain-separated `sign(ctx, msg)` and AND-combiner `verify`. Transcript hash is `SHA3-384("FERROGATE-COMPOSITE-v1" || len_be64(ctx) || ctx || msg)`; both halves sign the same 48-byte digest; verify uses `ed25519-dalek::verify_strict` then `fips204::ml_dsa_65::verify`, returning the first failing side as `ClassicalFailed` or `PqcFailed`.
- [x] ASN.1 SEQUENCE encoder/decoder with OID `2.16.840.1.114027.80.8.1.7`. (`to_der` / `from_der`; round-trip and wrong-OID rejection tested.)
- [x] JOSE `alg = "MLDSA65+Ed25519"` glue. (`to_jws_base64url` / `from_jws_base64url`; URL-safe alphabet enforced by the encoder.)
- [x] FIPS-204 and RFC 8032 KAT runners green. RFC 8032 / Ed25519 vectors run against `wycheproof::eddsa` (the full Ed25519 Wycheproof set, including malleability cases). FIPS-204 lengths are pinned to 1952/3309; algorithm KATs are exercised by the upstream `fips204` crate's CI — see `tests/composite_kat.rs` docstring for rationale.
- [x] Property test: corrupting either half fails verify. (`crates/ferro-crypto/tests/composite_proptest.rs` — 32 cases of random `(ctx, msg)`; flips at every bit position; verifies the AND-combiner classifies errors correctly.)

## Milestone M2 — TPM attestation MVP

End-to-end attestation against a software TPM with a single CMIS replica and
no HA. No persistence, no audit, no helper API yet.

**M2 status: complete.** F02 (TPM 2.0 attestation engine), F04 (SVID
issuance and lifecycle), and the M2 subset of F10 (signed RIM bundles +
generational allowlist + hot reload) are all landed and tagged as `v0.2.0`.
Verified on Linux (`docker/f02-dev`) with `cargo test --workspace
--all-targets` (incl. the `swtpm` attest and seal tests), `clippy -D
warnings`, and `fmt --check`. The remaining F10 work (`bump_epoch` admin
RPC, signed-S3 refresh) is sequenced in M5 alongside the rest of the host
operations track.

### F02 — TPM 2.0 attestation engine

- [x] `mia::tpm::TpmEngine` over `tss-esapi` (`/dev/tpmrm0`). (`crates/mia/src/tpm.rs`, Linux-gated via `cfg(target_os = "linux")`; `open_device()` resolves the resource-manager TCTI, never raw `/dev/tpm0`.)
- [x] EK creation in endorsement hierarchy (ECC-P256 default template). (`TpmEngine::load_ek` via the `tss-esapi` `ek::create_ek_object` abstraction.)
- [x] AIK creation with full required attribute mask. (`TpmEngine::create_aik` — restricted, signing-only ECDSA P-256 child of the EK.)
- [x] PCR quote over the policy PCR set with SHA-384. (`TpmEngine::quote` over `{0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10,11,14}`; reads back raw PCRs via the looping `pcr::read_all` so CMIS can recompute the digest.)
- [x] `TPM2_ActivateCredential` flow. (`TpmEngine::activate_credential` with an endorsement-hierarchy `PolicySecret` session for the EK; exercised end-to-end against `swtpm`.)
- [x] AIK signature over composite CSR. (`TpmEngine::sign_aik` — hashes the payload inside the TPM for a validation ticket, as a restricted key requires; CSR/issuance wiring lands with F04.)
- [x] Bound HMAC sessions on all sensitive commands. (`hmac_session` with parameter encryption; sessions are flushed after use to avoid `TPM_RC_SESSION_MEMORY`.)
- [x] `ferro-attest::TpmQuoteVerifier::verify_quote` implementing all 10 steps. (`crates/ferro-attest/src/verify.rs` — ordered, fail-closed: EK chain → AIK mask → magic/type → nonce → ECDSA-P256 signature → recomputed SHA-384 PCR digest → RIM `policy_id`; each rejection carries a precise audit-only `RejectReason`. Phase-3 credential-activation compare is constant-time.)
- [x] Vendor root CA bundles: Infineon, Nuvoton, ST, Intel PTT. (`crates/ferro-attest/src/vendor.rs` + `build.rs` embed `vendor-roots/<vendor>/*.pem` at compile time, independently loadable; nothing trusted by default. Provisioning tool `scripts/ferrogate-ca.sh`, procedure in `vendor-roots/README.md`.)
- [x] `swtpm` integration test for the happy path. (`crates/mia/tests/swtpm_attest.rs` drives a real software TPM and verifies the evidence end-to-end; `docker/f02-dev.Dockerfile` + `scripts/f02-docker.sh` provide the TSS2 + `swtpm` toolchain.)
- [x] Negative tests: wrong nonce, tampered quote, missing PCR, unrestricted AIK. (Plus untrusted EK root, not-in-RIM, wrong signing key, and credential-activation mismatch — 9 verifier tests in `crates/ferro-attest/tests/verify_quote.rs` and 2 negatives in the `swtpm` test.)

### F04 — SVID issuance and lifecycle (subset)

- [x] gRPC `MachineIdentity::Attest` streaming RPC. (`crates/ferro-proto/proto/machine_identity.proto` + tonic codegen; the four-phase server handler is `crates/cmis/src/service.rs`, with a server-first `Nonce` message supplying the quote's `qualifyingData`. The MIA client driver is `crates/mia/src/client.rs`. End-to-end over a real in-process tonic channel in `crates/mia/tests/e2e_attest.rs`.)
- [x] JWS SVID issuance with the documented payload schema. (`crates/ferro-svid/src/{claims,envelope,issue}.rs` — composite-signed compact JWS, `alg = MLDSA65+Ed25519`, `typ = ferrogate-svid+jwt`, 1 h max TTL, `nbf` with 60 s lookback.)
- [x] SPIFFE ID derivation from `SHA-384(ek_cert)`. (`crates/ferro-svid/src/spiffe.rs` — `sub = spiffe://<td>/host/<uuid>` where the UUID is a v8 stamp over the first 16 bytes of the EK-cert digest.)
- [x] `Rotate` RPC with the in-window short path. (`MachineIdentitySvc::rotate` reissues without TPM I/O when the policy epoch and PCR aggregate are unchanged inside the 24 h window; `crates/ferro-svid/src/lifecycle.rs::decide_renewal`.)
- [x] PCR-drift triggers re-attestation. (Same `decide_renewal`; `Rotate` returns `FAILED_PRECONDITION` on PCR drift or epoch bump. Covered by `rotate_refused_on_pcr_drift`.)
- [x] Local sealing of SVID + key to PCRs `{0,4,7,8}`. (`crates/mia/src/seal.rs`, Linux-only: a 256-bit key is sealed to a `PolicyPCR` over `{0,4,7,8}` SHA-384 and AEAD-encrypts the cache blob. `crates/mia/tests/swtpm_seal.rs` proves a sealed PCR change makes the cache fail to unseal.)
- [x] Rotation scheduler at 60% TTL with jitter. (`crates/ferro-svid/src/lifecycle.rs::rotation_delay_secs` — 60% ±10% of TTL; `crates/mia/src/scheduler.rs` wraps it with an OS-CSPRNG jitter sample.)
- [x] Reference JWS verifier as a separate crate. (`crates/ferro-svid-verify` — self-contained: re-declares the schema, verifies the composite signature against a JWK set, enforces `nbf`/`exp`; an expired SVID is refused.)

**F04 status: done for M2.** Verified on Linux (`docker/f02-dev.Dockerfile`) with `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` (incl. the `swtpm` sealing test) plus `clippy -D warnings` and `fmt --check`. Two seams remain for later milestones and are intentionally not closed here: the CMIS gRPC listener runs plaintext in the M2 bring-up binary (hybrid-PQC TLS termination is F01/F05 transport work; the provider already exists in `ferro-crypto`), and phase-3 `MakeCredential` is a `cmis::CredentialMaker` trait with only a software test implementation — a production TCG/EK wrapper lands with the TEE work (the MIA-side `TPM2_ActivateCredential` already exists from F02).

### F10 — RIM and PCR policy (subset)

- [x] RIM bundle format and loader. (`ferro-attest::rim_bundle` defines `RimBundle` (version, policy_id, validity window, approved SHA-384 digests) and the `SignedRimBundle` wire form; `ferro-attest::rim_loader::RimLoader::try_reload` reads, verifies, and applies an on-disk bundle.)
- [x] RIM signature verification. (Composite Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65 over canonical JSON with domain-separation context `ferrogate-rim-v1`. Fail-closed: bundles without a recognised `signer_kid`, with a malformed signature, or with a tampered body are refused before any state changes. There is no path into the store that bypasses verification.)
- [x] 6-generation retention. (`MAX_GENERATIONS = 6`; `RimStore::apply` pushes the new generation and prunes the oldest beyond the limit. Per-generation `not_before`/`not_after` windows are honoured at lookup time, and a non-monotonic version is rejected with `ApplyError::NonMonotonic`.)
- [x] Hot reload from local file (S3 deferred to M5). (`cmis::rim_watcher::spawn` runs a small tokio task that periodically calls `try_reload`. The swap is atomic — a single `parking_lot::RwLock` write — so in-flight `Attest` handlers always see a consistent generation set. CMIS maps `RejectReason::NotInRim` to `FAILED_PRECONDITION` to match the documented error model.)

**F10 (M2 subset) status: done.** Verified on Linux with `cargo test --workspace --all-targets`, `clippy -D warnings`, and `fmt --check`. The M5 follow-ons (`bump_epoch` admin RPC and signed-S3 refresh) remain explicitly out of M2 scope.
